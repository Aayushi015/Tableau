# 🚲 Citi Bike NYC 2023 Data Analysis

**📌 Project Overview**

As the lead analyst for the Citi Bike NYC Program, this project aims to analyze ridership trends, station activity, and seasonal patterns using Tableau. The goal is to generate insightful visualizations and interactive dashboards to assist city officials in improving bike-sharing operations.

**📊 Data Source**

The dataset for this project comes from the Citi Bike Trip History Logs, which includes trip details, station activity, user demographics, and ridership trends from January to December 2023.

**🎯 Key Analysis & Visualizations**

This project focuses on uncovering two key phenomena within Citi Bike data through the following visualizations:

**1️⃣ Ridership Trends & User Behavior**

- 📈 Total Ridership Over Time: Tracks the number of trips across different months.

- 🔄 Growth in Ridership: Analyzes the percentage increase in trips.

- 🕒 Peak Usage Hours: Identifies the busiest times of day for weekday commuters vs. weekend riders.

- 🎟 User Type Analysis: Compares usage patterns of annual subscribers vs. short-term users.


**2️⃣ Station Popularity & Route Patterns**

- 📍 Top 10 Most Popular Stations: Shows the busiest starting & ending locations.

- 🚲 Least Used Stations: Identifies underutilized docking stations.

- 🛣 Most Frequented Routes: Maps out the most traveled paths in the network.

- ⚙️ Bike Usage & Maintenance Needs: Detects bikes that are heavily used and may require servicing.


**🗺️ Interactive Map**


- 🗺 Basic Map: Static visualization of all Citi Bike stations, highlighting the most popular ones.

- 🌍 Advanced Map: A dynamic heatmap showing station usage over time, with zip code overlays.

**🏆 Final Dashboard & Presentation**

All visualizations are combined into a Tableau Story, featuring:

✅ Clear, interactive charts

✅ City official-friendly insights

✅ Professional and visually appealing design


**🚀 Deployment & Access**

The project is published on Tableau Public.

**🔍 Insights & Recommendations**

Commuter Trends: High ridership during weekday rush hours (8–10 AM & 5–7 PM) suggests demand for additional bike availability.
Leisure Usage: Increased weekend trips between 10 AM – 4 PM show potential for expanding docking stations near parks & tourist areas.
Seasonal Trends: Winter ridership drops, suggesting potential promotions for off-season biking.
Underutilized Stations: Identified locations with low trip counts, providing data for potential redistribution strategies.
